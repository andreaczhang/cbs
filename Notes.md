# Notes

Download subdirectory from https://github.com/raubreywhite/cbs/tree/master/Source/Analytics/D3Graphs/

```bash
andrea$ svn export https://github.com/raubreywhite/cbs/trunk/Source/Analytics/D3Graphs
```

(if want to check, use ls. basically just change `tree/master` to `trunk`)



In D3Graphs/ 

```bash
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

It compiles `components/App.js` via `index.js` via `index.html`.
